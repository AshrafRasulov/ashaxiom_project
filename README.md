# AshAxiom: Intelligent Math & Financial Ecosystem (v.2.3.8)

AshAxiom is a high-performance Python framework designed as a **Living Library**. It unifies academic mathematical rigor with modern financial analysis and decentralized AI integration.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The Golden Standard
AshAxiom uses a unified argument system across all expert books. You no longer need to guess variable names:
- **`expr`**: For formulas and equations.
- **`var`**: For symbols like 'x', 't', or 'n'.
- **`val`**: For numeric values (points, orders, periods).
- **`ticker`**: For assets (e.g., 'AAPL', 'BTC-USD').
- **`data`**: For collections (lists, matrices, arrays).

## 🧠 Parallel Intelligence (The Consilium)
When you call `.solve()`, AshAxiom triggers a **Parallel Consilium**. It searches through thousands of pages from Zorich, Krasnov, Murphy, and others, executing their logic simultaneously in background threads to provide instant results without hanging the UI.

## 🎓 Interactive Academy
AshAxiom includes a built-in learning server. You can launch the interactive courses directly from Jupyter:

```python
import ashaxiom
# Initialize the Brain and start the Academy
ashaxiom.Axiom.think().lesson().go()


Note: The Academy server provides localized training on math and financial principles.
📊 Visualization Engine
Synchronized '2D': Automatically aligns assets with different trading dates.
'3D' Projections: Visualizes the mathematical complexity spectrum with highlighted prediction vectors.
Lazy Styling: Apply colors and gradients via .color() before rendering.
